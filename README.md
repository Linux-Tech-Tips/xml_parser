# C++ XML Parser

A simple XML Parser for C++, with XML file saving/loading.

Mostly created as a project to practice C++ on.

Still Work In Progress, this version is an unfinished demo.

Also first bigger C++ project, so I'm still learning as I go basically. Excuse some terrible code in the past commits (and so far even in up-to-date commits.) 
If anyone asks, it's called *Agile Development*.
